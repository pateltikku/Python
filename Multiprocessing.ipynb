    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the capability of the Python programming language to create and manage multiple processes concurrently. The process has its own memory space, multiprocessing allows to harness the power of multi-core processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why multiprocessing is useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiprocessing facilitate to execute multiple tasks in parallel, making better use of multi-core processors. This can significantly improve the performance of CPU-bound tasks, such as data processing ec cetera.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. By dividing a problem into smaller tasks that can be executed concurrently, a significant performance boost can be achieved compared to running those tasks sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each process in multiprocessing has its own memory space, which means that if one process crashes or encounters an error, it typically won't affect other processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multiprocessing is particularly useful for breaking down a large problem into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks that can be solved concurrently easily. "

    "Multiprocessing and multithreading are both techniques used for achieving parallelism in a program, but they operate differently and have distinct use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between multiprocessing and multithreading-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiprocessing involves creating multiple separate processes, each with its own memory space and Python interpreter. These processes run independently and can take full advantage of multi-core processors. On the other hand,multithreading involves creating multiple threads within a single process. Threads share the same memory space and Python interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Since multiprocessing has its own memory space and interpreter, a crash or error in one process usually does not affect other processes. However, in multithreading a crash or an error in one thread can potentially crash the entire process because threads share the same memory space and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multiprocessing is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks, but multithreading is often used for I/O-bound tasks."
